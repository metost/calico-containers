# Troubleshooting
This article contains Kubernetes specific troubleshooting advice for Calico.  See also the [main Calico troubleshooting](../../Troubleshooting.md) guide.

## Viewing Logs
The Calico CNI plugin emits logs to the `/var/log/calico/cni/` directory.  All CNI plugin logs for a node will be emitted to
that directory.  Searching for logs with "ERROR" or "WARN" level is a good place to start if you are having trouble. 

The log level can be configured via the CNI network configuration file, by changing the value of the key `log_level`.
By default, the plugin will only emit "info" level and higher.  Valid log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and
`error`.

It may also be useful in some situations to check the kubelet logs for a given node.  For deployments using `systemd`,
you can do this via `journalctl`.
